            <p>With the recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, AI will soon dominate the software engineering industry. Machine learning will make development faster and more efficient by automating the testing process of software. Furthermore, with AI, software will become increasingly complex and tailored to users' needs with the assistance of AI's ability to understand natural language processing. It is evident that AI will not replace software developers, but instead complement and further increase their productivity in the development process.</p>
