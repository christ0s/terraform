        <h1>Why AI will dominate Software Engineering</h1>
        <p>In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has become more than just a buzzword. With advances in deep learning algorithms, natural language processing, and computer vision, AI is poised to dominate the software engineering industry. With AI's ability to automate tasks, speed up development time, and improve code quality, it is no wonder why businesses across industries have begun investing in this technology. As software engineering grows more complex, developers will need AI to continue solving problems and maintaining programs. In other words, AI will enhance, not replace, software engineering. </p>
